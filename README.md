# UW2019-VR-Treadmill-Optimization
Optimization of Virtualizer omnidirectional treadmill.  Describes an approach to increasing degrees of freedom when using the Virtualizer by decoupling the user's head rotation from that of their body.  Developed by the University of Wyoming Spatial Cognition Lab and Presented at IEEE VR 2019 in Osaka, Japan.

!- WARNING -!

* The Code AND the Fully functional Unity app provided, will NOT work unless you have the CybSDK DLLs installed on your machine.
* Because of this, we have included them under "Treadmill/CybSDK/DLLs/" for you.
* There are two version, one for 64 bit and the other for 32 bit machines.
* We reccommend downloading and adding both to your Unity project and letting Unity itself decide which to choose.

## Usage
  * The Critical Code can be found under the "Treadmill" folder.  Be warned that it requires Cyberith's suite of development scripts (and a Nirtualizer Omnidirectional Treadmill) to actually run.  If you have the requsites, great! If not, we hope the code can at least get the gears moving on how to apply a similar solution to your projects.
